<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The need to build tall buildings has been increasing worldwide, creating new
challenges in earthquake engineering and design. Many of the current analysis
methods cannot be extrapolated beyond the definition under which they were
established. Prior studies and existing seismic design guidelines have indicated that
the current fixed-base hypothesis for evaluating the seismic response of structures is
not sufficient to properly represent the boundary conditions and behavior of tall
buildings with basement levels. Studies of soil-structure interaction (SSI) for tall
buildings have, however, typically been inconclusive. It is not clear under which
conditions consideration of soil-basement-structure interaction (SBSI) is necessary for
the design of the superstructure, foundation, and basement levels and when it can
safely be avoided. Given the rising demand, it is essential to evaluate the relation of
global system variables such as the basement depth, structure height, and soil
characteristics with the building's response via numerical and experimental modeling.
Therefore, an experimental-numerical approach is presented to better understand the
seismic response of tall buildings with basement levels, considering explicit SBSI
modeling. Chilean tall buildings and soil conditions are used as study cases, analyzed
using non-linear finite element analyses in conjunction with results from centrifuge
experiments. The results show how seismic response parameters and modals
characteristics, such as inter-story drifts, shear force, bending moment, natural
frequencies and damping ratios, change when SBSI is appropriately incorporated. The
results point to the importance of considering soil-basement-interaction effects to
evaluate the seismic response of tall buildings with basement levels and avoid unsafe
estimations or the need for overdesign.</p>

*How Do Tall Buildings Affect Seismic Earth Pressures on Their Basement Walls?*. Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering
</summary>
<p>![Fig 1](<img alt="Fig 1" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qi1wfe4qzbknv76/fig1.png?raw=1"></p>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Construction of tall buildings has recently gone through an exponential growth in major
cities, creating new challenges in earthquake engineering and design. For instance,
existing analytical procedures for evaluating seismic lateral earth pressures on
basement walls that are connected to these buildings typically ignore the inertia and
dynamic properties of the superstructure. The inertial forces from a tall superstructure
may cause additional displacements and rotations in its basement that would affect the
distribution and magnitude of seismic lateral earth pressures. These additional soil-
basement-structure interaction (SBSI) effects are currently not well understood. Hence,
the applicability and reliability of existing procedures to the basements of tall buildings
remains questionable. In this paper, we use an experimental-numerical approach to
provide insight on how the lateral resisting system of tall superstructures may impact
the magnitude and distribution of seismic earth pressures on basement walls buried in
dry sand and gravel. Numerical simulations are first validated in 3D using a prior
centrifuge experiment that included a simplified model of a 42-story, highrise structure
in medium-dense, dry sand. Then, the numerical tool is used to perform 156, 2D,
nonlinear simulations of more realistic buildings and basements, ground motion
characteristics, as well as both sandy and gravely soil profiles. Nonlinear numerical
simulations are shown to successfully capture the building’s inertial and kinematic
seismic interactions with the basement and an adjacent underground structure. The
subsequent numerical sensitivity study showed that inertial forces from a tall
superstructure increase total lateral earth pressures on the basement walls. This
increase is particularly notable in the top two-thirds of the basement wall and can be
approximated by a trapezoidal distribution. The superstructure’s inertia amplifies the
seismic earth pressure increments at shallow depths, with an approximately inverted
triangular shape. These effects and reliability of existing analytical procedures are
shown to be highly sensitive to the building’s modal frequencies in relation to the
frequency content of the input motion as well as the stiffness of the structure-basement
system in relation to the underlying soil. The results point to the importance of
considering the building’s dynamic properties and inertia in evaluation of seismic earth
pressures on basement walls, in order to avoid unsafe estimations or the need for
overdesign.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p><code>ShakerMaker</code> is an open-source python framework which simplifies the
generation of synthetic broad-band seismograms, produced by finite-fault
kinematic representations of earthquake ruptures, using a 1-D layered model
of the crust and the frequency-wavenumber (<span class="math">\(f\)</span>–<span class="math">\(k\)</span>) method. It is designed to
bring closer the engineering seismology and earthquake engineering communi-
ties, by catering to the earthquake simulation needs of both disciplines. One
particular goal of this framework is to provide a simple way to produce high-
fidelity earthquake motions for use with the domain-reduction method, sim-
plifying the setup of physically accurate finite-element simulations of multi-
scale seismological and earthquake engineering problems through the use of
a new specialized file format.
<code>ShakerMaker</code>’s core is composed of a high-performance Fortran imple-
mentation of the <span class="math">\(f\)</span>-<span class="math">\(k\)</span> method, that is exposed to the user as a python frame-
work. Its software architecture emphasizes simplicity, extensibility, and per-
formance, allowing users to specify complex simulation scenarios with short
scripts. The message passing interface is used to achieve scalability from
simple single-processor machines to HPC clusters.</p>

<!-- Serviceability criteria for offshore monopiles include the estimation of long-term, permanent tilt under repeated operational loads. In the lack of well-established analysis methods, experimental and numerical research has been carried out in the last decade to support the fundamental understanding of monopile-soil interaction mechanisms, and the conception of engineering methods for monopile tilt predictions. With focus on the case of monopiles in sand, this work shows how step-by-step/implicit, three-dimensional finite element modelling can be fruitfully applied to the analysis of cyclic monopile-soil interaction and related soil deformation mechanisms. To achieve adequate simulation of cyclic sand ratcheting and densification around the pile, the SANISAND-MS model recently proposed by Liu et al. (2019) is adopted. The link between local soil behaviour and global monopile response to cyclic loading is discussed through detailed analysis of model prediction. Overall, the results of numerical parametric studies confirm that the proposed 3D FE modelling framework can reproduce relevant experimental evidence about monopile-soil interaction, and support future improvement of engineering design methods. -->

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The present work extends the capabilities of the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM), which allows modeling of soil-fluid-structure interaction problems, to allow the modeling of sediment transport and scouring effects. This is accomplished by implementing scouring rules on an evolving scourable-interface, i.e. the interface surface between fluid and soil. The proposed method improves upon previous proposals by jointly capturing both the temporal and spatial scales of scouring evolution, as shown in the presented validation exercise, and also because its parametrization is conforms with commonplace engineering procedures for scouring prediction. The extension preserves desirable PFEM properties such as conservation of mass, mesh-size independence, and stability of the numerical solution of the PFEM equations.</p>

</summary>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This work presents a critical state plasticity model for predicting the response of sands to cyclic loading. The well-known bounding surface SANISAND framework by Dafalias &amp; Manzari (2004) is enhanced with a `memory surface' to capture micro-mechanical, fabric-related processes directly effecting cyclic sand behaviour. The resulting model, SANISAND-MS, was recently proposed by Liu et al. (2019) , and successfully applied to the simulation of drained sand ratcheting under thousands of loading cycles. Herein, novel ingredients are embedded into Liu et al. (2019) 's formulation to better capture the effects of fabric evolution history on sand stiffness and dilatancy. The new features enable remarkable accuracy in simulating undrained pore pressure build-up and cyclic mobility behaviour in medium-dense/dense sand. The performance of the upgraded SANISAND-MS is validated against experimental test results from the literature - including undrained cyclic triaxial tests at varying cyclic loading conditions and pre-cyclic consolidation histories. The proposed modelling platform will positively impact the study of relevant cyclic/dynamic problems, for instance, in the fields of earthquake and offshore geotechnics.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The gas−liquid mass transfer coefficient is a key parameter to the design and operation of biotrickling filters that governs the transport rate of contaminants and oxygen from the gas phase to the liquid phase, where pollutant biodegradation occurs. Mass transfer coefficients are typically estimated via experimental procedures to produce empirical correlations, which are only valid for the bioreactor configuration and range of operational conditions under investigation. In this work, a new method for the estimation of the gas−liquid mass transfer coefficient in biotrickling filters is presented. This novel methodology couples a realistic description of the packing media (polyurethane foam without a biofilm) obtained using microtomography with computational fluid dynamics. The two-dimensional analysis reported in this study allowed capturing the mechanisms of the complex processes involved in the creeping porous air and water flow in the presence of capillary effects in biotrickling filters. Model predictions matched the experimental mass transfer coefficients (±30%) under a wide range of operational conditions.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The modelling and simulation of cyclic sand ratcheting is tackled via a plasticity model formulated withinthe well-known critical state, bounding surface SANISAND framework. For this purpose, a third locus –termed ‘memory surface’ – is cast into the constitutive formulation, so as to phenomenologically capturemicro-mechanical, fabric-related processes directly relevant to the cyclic response. The predictive capabilityof the model under numerous loading cycles (‘high-cyclic’ loading) is explored with focus on drainedloading conditions, and validated against experimental test results from the literature – including triaxial,simple shear and oedometer cyclic loading. The model proves capable of reproducing the transition fromratcheting to shakedown response, in combination with a single set of soil parameters for different initial,boundary and loading conditions. This work contributes to the analysis of soil-structure interaction underhigh-cyclic loading events, such as those induced by environmental and/or traffic loads. </p>

<p>In soil-structure interaction modeling of systems subjected to earthquake motions, it is classically assumed that the incoming wave field, produced by an earthquake, is unidimensional and vertically propagating. This work explores the validity of this assumption by performing earthquake soil-structure interaction modeling, including explicit modeling of sources, seismic wave propagation, site, and structure. The domain reduction method is used to couple seismic (near-field) simulations with local soil-structure interaction response. The response of a generic nuclear power plant model computed using full earthquake soil-structure interaction simulations is compared with the current state-of-the-art method of deconvolving in depth the (simulated) free-field motions, recorded at the site of interest, and assuming that the earthquake wave field is spatially unidimensional. Results show that the 1-D wave-field assumption does not hold in general. It is shown that the way in which full 3-D analysis results differ from those which assume a 1-D wave field is dependent on fault-to-site geometry and motion frequency content. It is argued that this is especially important for certain classes of soil-structure systems of which nuclear power plants subjected to near-field earthquakes are an example.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Conventional acceleration records do not properly account for the observed coseismic ground displacements, thus leading to an inaccurate definition of the seismic demand needed for the design of flexible (long-period) structures. Large coseismic displacements observed during the Feb 27, 2010, Maule earthquake, suggest that this effect should be included in the design of flexible structures by modifying the design ground-motions and spectra considered. Consequently, Green’s Functions are used herein to compute synthetic low-frequency seismograms that are consistent with the coseismic displacement field obtained from interferometry using synthetic aperture radar images. In this case, the coseismic displacement field was determined by interfering twenty SAR images of the ALOS-PALSAR satellite taken between 10/12/2007 and 05/28/2010. These images cover the region affected by the M w 8.8 2010, Maule earthquake. Synthetic broadband seismograms are built by superimposing the low-pass filtered synthetic low-frequency seismograms with high-frequency strong-motion data. The broadband seismograms generated are then consistent with the coseismic displacement field and the high-frequency content of the earthquake. A sensitivity analysis is performed using three different fault and slip parameters, the rupture velocity, the corner frequency, and the slip rise time. Results show that the optimal corner frequency of the low-pass filter <span class="math">\(f_c = 1/T_c\)</span> , leads to a trade-off between acceleration and displacement accuracy. Furthermore, spectral response for long periods, say <span class="math">\(T \ge 8s\)</span>, is relatively insensitive to the value of <span class="math">\(T_c\)</span> , while shorter periods are strongly dependent on both, the slip rise time and <span class="math">\(T_c\)</span> . In general, larger displacements consistent with coseismic data are obtained using this technique instead of digitally processing the acceleration ground-motion records.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Tall buildings and flexible structures require a better characterization of long period ground motion spectra than the one provided by current seismic building codes. Motivated by that, a methodology is proposed and tested to improve recorded and synthetic ground motions which are consistent with the observed co-seismic displacement field obtained from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis of image data for the Tocopilla 2007 earthquake (<span class="math">\(M_w=7.7\)</span>) in Northern Chile. A methodology is proposed to correct the observed motions such that, after double integration, they are coherent with the local value of the residual displacement. Synthetic records are generated by using a stochastic finite-fault model coupled with a long period pulse to capture the long period fling effect.It is observed that the proposed co-seismic correction yields records with more accurate long-period spectral components as compared with regular correction schemes such as acausal filtering. These signals provide an estimate for the velocity and displacement spectra, which are essential for tall-building design. Furthermore, hints are provided as to the shape of long-period spectra for seismic zones prone to large co-seismic displacements such as the Nazca-South American zone.</p>
